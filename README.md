## User Experience (UX)
SudoLogic was designed with a user-centred approach to ensure an engaging, accessible, and intuitive Sudoku experience. By following Jesse Jame Garrett's Five Planes of UX - **Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, and Surface** i the design and functionality of the site were carefully planned and executed to meet both the user and the business goals.

- Save game progress automatically and resume later.
- Share results and celebrate completion with animations.
- Enjoy a fun and frustration-free experience with accessibility features.
